                        <p>If you were to write in Kannada Letter on a slate in a school in America it will not make such sense to the people there as for them, it is nothing more than a geometrical pattern. But for us, the alphabet has a definite sound and a definite meaning.
                        <br /><br />What is an Alphabet? It is the form we give to a particular sound. Sound takes the form of different alphabets in different languages.
                        A language is composed of alphabets which signify different sounds. These alphabets when arranged in a particular fashion result in words. Hence the most basic form of sound is alphabet.
                        Though there are many languages in this world Sanskrit has the unique disction of being called the divine language. Sanskrit is different from other languages in the sense that it has a unique richness as well as engmatic experience on those who speak the languages.
                        <br /><br />Sound has the inherent quality of energizing from silence or vaccum. But it soon takes on the shape of alphabets. All sounds have a cosmic quality about them selves.
                        <br /><br />The positive vibrations that the sound generates are known as the 'Aa' and 'Ka' and these are the basic of all sounds and are crucial for the development language.
                        Mantras(sounds) take the form of yantras(form) and the technique of knowing mantra and tantra is called Tantra.
                        <br /><br />To know more about how rhythm becomes Vedas, Vedas become mantras, mantras become yantras and how yantra assume their power, visit the centre for vedic studies, which is one of the nine such centres at Vyasa Veda Peeta.

                            <br /><br />But bookish knowledge is an illusion. <br /><br />Essence of veda is the truth beyond pedantary. <br />Veda is testimony for veda. It is experience of seers in deep meditation. Veda mantras are the prime for of language. <br />"bhava bhudi" was called its "sacred form" mundane language follows
                            meaning. <br />But in sacred language meaning follows it. Here meaning is the strength of language. this power creates meanings in subtle veda mantras (chantings) have this power of creation. Mantra have rhythmic sound (nada) along with meaning.

                            Most animals live on non-vegetarian food and it is against nature to violate these rules. Since man has the power to think he can consciously exclude non-vegetarian food and eat only vegetarian but give up this, he must first deeply contemplate on it, That is
                            when he rises above 'TAMAS' and 'RAJAS' and elevates himself to 'SATVA'.
                            <br /><br />
                            Man starts treading the path of 'Ahimsa' when he consciously accepts vegetarianism and slowly it becomes part of his personality. Vegetarianism is a divine way of practicing non-violence. Through Ahimsa, one can be in the path if righteousness and spread the values
                            of compassion, love and kindness in the world. This is a form of spiritual consolidation. Vegetarianism is a cultural movement and it advocatesnon-violence against animals. People should come together and practice this principle. In India, vegetarianism is a way of 
                            life and people continue to practice it.

                            Ayurveda means, literally, science of life "anu" being the Sanskrit word for "life" and "veda" for knowledge, As its name suggests, Ayurveda is a body of knowledge. Ayurveda not only aims to eradicate the underlying causes of disease, it begins from and altogether deeper level, 
                            creating a balance within body and soul that acts as an effective defense against illness. In Ayurveda the prevention of disease is even more important than its cure.
                            <br /><br />
                            According to Ayurveda, however just about everything is connected to your state of health. Not only does it see you in a holistic light there are no barriers between body, mind and spirit in Ayurveda it sees you as a part of the environment, nature and the universe beyond.
                            For you to be healthy and content, you must be in harmony not just within yourself but with the worlds around you. Harmony and balance these are the starting points of Ayurveda and the place to which it always returns. Ayurveda turns this
